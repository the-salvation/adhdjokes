This is React Native template, with preset-up navigation, simple theme, components structure, svg.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

# Components Structure

This template is using free interpretation of Atomic Design, methodology conceptualized by Brad Frost. It's based on the idea that a user interface should be broken down into fundamental parts,
much like matter is broken down into atoms. This approach helps in building consistent, scalable, and reusable components.

1. Atoms
   Definition: Atoms are the smallest possible components, like HTML tags such as a form label, an input, or a button. They can be used as they are or, more commonly, combined to create more complex molecules.
   Examples: Text fields, buttons, checkboxes.

2. Molecules
   Definition: Molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. They are formed by combining atoms.
   Examples: A form label, input, and button combined to make a search form.

3. Organisms
   Definition: Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.
   Examples: A header containing a logo (atom), navigation (molecule), and a search form (molecule).

4. Screens
   Definition: Large groups of organisms stitched together to form screen. It's here where you start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.
   Examples: Full application screen with header, content etc.

# SVG

SVG must be stored in /src/assets. To use, import your .svg file inside a React component:

```jsx
import Logo from './logo.svg';
```

You can then use your image as a component:

```jsx
<Logo width={120} height={40} />
```
